# sysStatsDiscordRPC
there are many versions of this kinda thing
basically clone the repo and do `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
replace the client id in `client_id.txt` if you want to change the name of the presence, the default one is just "PC Stats"  
then run `python3 main.py`  
if there is any output to the terminal other than "RPC connected successfully ^_^", it probably isnt working right. create an issue [here](https://github.com/verbes4/sysStatsDiscordRPC/issues)
